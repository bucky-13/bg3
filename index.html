        <p>
          Astarion is a High Elf Rogue who has prowled the night as a vampire
          spawn for centuries, serving a sadistic master until he was snatched
          away. Now he can walk in the light, but can he leave his wicked past
          behind?

        <p>
          A Human Wizard, Gale has one ambition: to become the greatest wizard
          Faerun has ever known. Yet his thirst for magic led to disaster. A
          Netherese Destruction Orb beats in his chest, counting down to an
          explosion that can level a city. Gale is confident he'll overcome it,
          but time is not on his side.

          deep within the Shattered Sanctum. Halsin is the first Druid of the
          Druid Grove, but has been missing since he left with Aradin's
          expetidition.

        <p>
          Karlach, a Zariel Tiefling, once committed terrible deeds in the
          thrall of a powerful Archdevil. This Barbarian has an Infernal Machine
          for a heart that keeps her body burning red-hot. Newly freed from her
          master's grasp, she seeks revenge on those who sold her to the devil.

        <p>
          Lae'zel is a consummate Fighter, ferocious even by the standards of a
          Githyanki creche. Faced with transforming into the very monster she
          has sworn to destroy, Lae'zel must prove herself worthy of rejoining
          her people - if they do not execute her first.

        <p>
          Minsc was a kind-hearted—but rather addled— Rashemaar warrior that
          enjoyed many adventures across the Sword Coast and beyond. He joined
          many adventuring parties throughout the 14th and 15th centuries DR,
          including the Heroes of Baldur's Gate. Minsc was famously known for
          his habit of talking to a hamster called Boo, whom he believed was a
          miniature giant space hamster, despite no one else ever witnessing any
          evidence of this.

        <p>
          Minthara is an NPC and potential Boss or Companion in Baldur's Gate 3.
          Minthara can first be found in Act I within the Shattered Sanctum,
          inside the Goblin Camp as one of the three Goblin leaders. Siding with
          her allows the opening of the branching storyline that allows Tav to
          side with the Goblins and start the Quest Raid the Grove which may
          lead to recruiting her in Act II.

        <p>
          A High Half-Elf Trickster Domain Cleric, and one of Shar's dark
          disciples, Shadowheart was sent on a suicide mission to steal an item
          of great power. While wrestling with her faith and strange, untamed
          magic, Shadowheart has enemies on all sides - and a long-buried secret
          to uncover

        <p>
          A Human Warlock, and Noble by birth, Wyll made his name as the heroic
          'Blade of Frontiers'. He keeps his pact with a devil well-hidden and
          is desperate to escape the hellish bargain - even if that means
          rescuing the seductive creature that made the deal.
